# Josephus problem

Or something like [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem).

Suppose we are in a circle. From some starting point, X you count k people. If you are standing in that kth spot, you 
are ‘out’.  The counting continues until there is one person standing.

This simple Scala application takes in 2 parameters: the number of people in the circle (n) and the step rate (k). For 
example, if k is the step rate, then you skip k-1 people and eliminate the kth person. The output of the program will
point out to the place you need to stand in the circle to be the last person left.

**To run the program**: type *sbt “run n k”* (where n and k are the parameters; see above).
